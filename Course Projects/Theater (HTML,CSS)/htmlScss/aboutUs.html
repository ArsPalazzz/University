                        <h1>History</h1>
                        <p>In the summer of 1918, a historic meeting between Konstantin Stanislavsky and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko took place, lasting 18 hours. It was then that the decision was made to create a Belarusian Utopian Theater and its basic principles were laid down. Now it is impossible to imagine the world theater without the reforms of the Moscow Art Theater. Throughout its history, the theater has set new directions for development in art and public life, discovered new names and served as a benchmark for modern theater.</p>

                        <p>The new government treated the Art Theater favorably. In 1919, he was awarded the title of "academic", and since 1932 he became known as the "Maxim Gorky Moscow Art Theater of the USSR". The theater was recognized as a model for the rest of the country's repertory theaters, and Stanislavsky's System was the only true theory of stage art. The period of "omkhachivaniye" of Soviet theaters began.<br>
                        In parallel, after the triumphant 1922 tour of Europe and the USA, Stanislavsky's system, reworked by his students M. Chekhov and others, became the basis of acting education in the USA. According to this method , K. was trained . Eastwood, M. Monroe, D. Nicholson, G. Peck, E. Hopkins and other Hollywood stars.<br>The theater emerged from the repertory crisis of the 1920s through cooperation with young talented writers of those years: M. Bulgakov, V. Kataev, L. Leonov, Vs. Ivanov, K. Trenev.In 1938 , K. died . Stanislavsky. In 1943 – V. Nemirovich-Danchenko, who managed to stage in 1940 the most significant performance of the Soviet period – "Three Sisters" by Chekhov.</p>

                        <h2>Utopian Theater of the USSR (1944-1991)</h2>
                        <p>After the death of V. Nemirovich-Danchenko, actors N. Khmelev and I. Moskvin were at the head of the Moscow Art Theater for several years. After their death, the theater was run for more than two decades by an Artistic Council consisting of V. Stanitsyn, B. Livanov, M. Kedrov, V. Bogomolov. In 1970, the head of the Moscow Art Theater was appointed actor, director, creator of the Sovremennik theater O. Efremov.<br>
                        A graduate of the Moscow Art Theater Studio School, Yefremov tried to return the theater to its origins – to the concept of "theater-house", artistic search and harmony of time. The repertoire includes plays by young playwrights: M. Roshchin, A. Volodin, V. Rozov, A. Gelman, A. Vampilov. At the same time, work was underway with Russian and foreign classics, primarily with the plays of A. Chekhov. Young talented directors were attracted to work in the theater: A. Vasiliev, A. Efros, K. Ginkas, M. Rozovsky, R. Viktyuk. Efremov brought outstanding actors to the troupe: A. Kalyagin, I. Smoktunovsky, O. Borisov, A. Vertinskaya, E. Evstigneev, O. Tabakov, T. Doronin.<br>
                        The theater's productions caused a great cultural resonance and enjoyed wide popularity among the audience.</p>

                        <h2>Belarusian Utopian Theater (1992-2018)</h2>
                        <p>The growth of the theater troupe, internal problems and crisis socio-political events of the late USSR led to the split of the Moscow Art Theater in 1987. Part of the troupe led by O. Efremov left the collective and founded the theater in the historical building of the Moscow Art Theater in Kamergersky Lane. The Moscow Art Theater named after M. Gorky, under the leadership of the outstanding actress T. Doronina, continued work in the new theater building on Tverskoy Boulevard, built according to the project of architect V. Kubasov. In the perestroika and post-perestroika years, the Moscow Art Theater found itself in opposition to the processes taking place in the country and theatrical life.<br>
                        The main activity of the Moscow Art Theater under T. Doronina was the preservation of the traditions of the Russian psychological theater. The basis of the repertoire was the time-tested Russian, Soviet and foreign classics: plays by A. Ostrovsky, A. Chekhov, M. Gorky, M. Bulgakov, A. Arbuzov, V. Rasputin, W. Shakespeare, B. Shaw. The great merit of the theater during this period was the preservation in the repertoire of the only surviving productions of the founders of the Moscow Art Theater – the performances "Blue Bird" and "Three Sisters". Performances with the participation of T. Doronina, which since 2018, have enjoyed particular success. holds the honorary position of the president of the theater.</p>

                        <p>In 1977, V. Rasputin wrote a dramatization of his story specifically for the Moscow Art Theater. On May 8, 2019, "The Last Term" returned to the stage of the Gorky Moscow Art Theater in a new production by S. Puskepalis. The performance takes the viewer to a Soviet village to a dying old woman and makes him remember his roots, his duty to his parents and the bitter fate of a woman.</p>
