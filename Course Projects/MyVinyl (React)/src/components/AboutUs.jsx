                <h1>About us</h1>
                <p>We are pleased to offer you a wide selection of vinyl at affordable prices. We regularly arrange discounts, promotions and sales. We sell only new and original records. Our main goal and fundamental principle in our work is customer satisfaction, since we do not sell music, we sell musical pleasure. We are ready to help you find even rare recordings! To do this, just leave a request. And we will do our best to help you get the desired record. We are friends with many "anonymous vinylers". These people, like us, depend on good music and are not going to be treated for their addiction!</p>
